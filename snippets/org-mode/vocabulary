### 🧠 How to Think in English to Learn "Abase"

> “To **abase** is to bring someone **down to the base level** — socially, emotionally, or morally.”

Imagine someone **standing tall** and then being **pushed downward** — not physically, but in terms of **respect or status**.

- **Visual trick**: Think of the word **"base"** as the **bottom floor**, and “abasing” someone is **pushing them down to that floor**.  
- Use the phrase:  
  > “I will not abase myself” → “I won’t lower myself just to please others.”
