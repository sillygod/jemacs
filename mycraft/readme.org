* Configurations

  A literal programming for my own emacs configs.

** prerequisite

*** some util tools
    #+begin_src sh
      curl -Ls https://raw.githubusercontent.com/daipeihust/im-select/master/install_mac.sh | sh
      brew install ispell pngpaste
    #+end_src

*** install emacs-plus

    #+begin_src sh
      brew install emacs-plus@29 --with-xwidgets --with-modern-papirus-icon --with-native-comp
    #+end_src

*** spawn the emacs

    #+begin_src bash
      emacs -Q --load init.el
    #+end_src


* Start to build my own emacs

  Wow almost complete :)

** things needed to be done or enahnced

   - [X] add run test for go mode
   - [ ] doom modeline is so slow after updating (cause flashing with which-key, auto highlight)
   - [ ] wirte a hydra for iedit mode
   - [ ] https://github.com/wbolster/emacs-python-coverage
   - [ ] https://github.com/emacs-lsp/lsp-mode/issues/1863 (try this if you want to use pylance instead of pyright)
   - [ ] toggle window maximum should be memorized with projectile (https://oremacs.com/2016/06/27/ivy-push-view/)
   - [ ] check devdocs' functionality and pop-up with window-frame
   - [ ] implement my own run-python-shell
   - [ ] code folding problem (hideshow?) (lsp?)
   - [ ] [[https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs/tree/develop/modules/ui/popup][window management (doom emacs)]] or consider [[https://github.com/bmag/emacs-purpose][this package]]
   - [ ] https://github.com/techniumlabs/ecloud/blob/master/gcp-overview.el
   - [ ] https://github.com/NicolasPetton/Indium (consider to add this package)
   - [ ] [[https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs/blob/develop/layers/%2Bmisc/multiple-cursors/packages.el][integration for multiple cursor from spacemacs]]
   - [ ] add continuous integration for this emacs literate programming setup (but how to test?)

** program relavant config

   - [ ] implement a function that lsp auto reload when poetry venv toggle
   - [ ] a better go to definition handler
   - [ ] how to copy in the xwidget mode with evil yank
   - [ ] add re builder mode shorcuts

** better to have

   - [ ] a startup dashboard ([[https://github.com/rougier/nano-emacs/blob/master/nano-splash.el][reference]])
   - [ ] tree sitter (https://emacs-tree-sitter.github.io/)
   - [ ] add lookup function like doom emacs (which is based on counsel-search)
   - [ ] interactive sql mode
   - [ ] spacemacs' org-doc-view mode?
   - [ ] https://github.com/osener/emacs-webkit-color-picker
   - [ ] https://github.com/quelpa/quelpa need this?
   - [ ] adopt darkroom package?
   - [ ] write a plugin to read some good blogs, articles from some website (ex. https://stackoverflow.blog/)
   - [ ] k8s editor mode https://github.com/TxGVNN/emacs-k8s-mode/blob/master/k8s-mode.el

** some questions

   - [X] to understand the source code of some implementation from =spacemacs=
   - [X] what does the =command= in the use-package do (make the command to be autoloaded)
   - [X] what is =featurep=


* Notes

** something
   #+begin_src emacs-lisp
     (with-selected-window (next-window)
       (org-element-parse-buffer))
   #+end_src

** to see the visualization of git history

   #+begin_src sh
     docker run --rm -p 8080:80 --name envisaged -v /Users/jing/Desktop/spacemacs-private/:/visualization/git_repo:ro -e GOURCE_TITLE="spacemacs private" utensils/envisaged
   #+end_src
