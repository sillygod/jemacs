* Customize your emacs (+spacemacs is abandoned+)

  Let's start to customize your emacs(+spacemacs+). Note the directory =mycraft= is an experimental of crafting self-spacemacs and that's what

* Install

  #+begin_src shell
    git clone https://github.com/sillygod/spacemacs-private.git
  #+end_src

* Description

  An experimental emacs setup for my workflow and trying to make it flexible to be easily shaped for others people.
