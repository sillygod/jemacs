* Customize your emacs (+spacemacs is abandoned+)

  Let's start to customize your emacs(+spacemacs+). Note the directory =mycraft= is an experimental of crafting self-spacemacs and that's what
  I am focusing on.

  Note: some directories are still preserved because I am not completely transfer all the functions and workflows from the =spacemacs=.

* Install

  Clone this repo to the =~/.emacs.d/private=

  #+begin_src shell
    git clone https://github.com/sillygod/spacemacs-private.git ~/.emacs.d/private
  #+end_src

  Or you can clone to other directory and then create a soft link to the directory.
  Choose the way you like!

* Description

  A minimum configuration to mimic the spacemacs' ux.

* Personal configuration

  Currently, I preffer put configuration in the file =.spacemacs= instead of using my =config= layer.

* Reference

 Here are some tutorials. In addition, I put some notes on the =spacemacs_tips.org=
