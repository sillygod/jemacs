* What is this

  This is a literal programming for my own emacs configs and is an experimental emacs setup for my workflow.
  Furthermore, if I can, I will trying to make it flexible to be easily shaped for others people.

* Installation
** prerequisite

   the following steps are specific for mac osx

*** some util tools
    #+begin_src sh
      curl -Ls https://raw.githubusercontent.com/daipeihust/im-select/master/install_mac.sh | sh # install im-select
      brew install ispell pngpaste ripgrep
    #+end_src

*** install emacs-plus

    #+begin_src sh
      brew install emacs-plus@30 --with-xwidgets --with-modern-papirus-icon --with-native-comp
    #+end_src

** clone the repo

  #+begin_src bash
    git clone https://github.com/sillygod/jemacs.git ~/.emacs.d
  #+end_src

  copy ~example-settings.el~ to ~settings.el~ and modify it
  then produce the setup files of core and modules by the following the command

  #+begin_src bash
    bash lp.sh
  #+end_src

  Once you setup config completely, you can also produce those files by elisp function ~export-lp-configs~

*** spawn the emacs

    #+begin_src bash
      emacs # -debug-init
    #+end_src

* Run in docker

** setup the XQuartz
  https://gist.github.com/cschiewek/246a244ba23da8b9f0e7b11a68bf3285

  then start xhost

  #+begin_src bash
    xhost +localhost
  #+end_src

  pull docker image or you build it by your own.

    #+begin_src bash
    docker pull ghcr.io/sillygod/jemacs/emacs:latest
    docker run -it --rm --env="DISPLAY=docker.for.mac.host.internal:0" -v /tmp/.X11-unix:/tmp/.X11-unix -v [/your/workspace/]:[/mnt/workspace]ghcr.io/sillygod/jemacs/emacs
  #+end_src
