* Exercism

** Why I write Exercism
   
This is the first plugin I write for emacs. Why I decide to write this? One of the reason is I want to practice the emacs lisp and the other is I want to reduce the redundant steps when I want to solve some exercises on the Exercism.

I usually go to the exercism website, copy the command and than paste it on the terminal. Then, I start to open my emacs, find the file and open it! After I solve the problem, I have to run a command to submit my solution. Oh, I feel I can not move my fingers. So I want to write some emacs lisp to make these steps streamlining.

** I still want to implement although I find there is package called exercism..
   
I think is outdated. Lots of function are not worked today
