* Notes

So what will happend after calling =re-search-backward=?
It seems that we need to call =match-string-no-properties= to get the result.

match-string-no-properties this will return the result of last search (not limited to
regular expression search)

#+begin_src go
  func TestHelloWorld(t *testing.T) {
      fmt.Println("hi")
  }
#+end_src
